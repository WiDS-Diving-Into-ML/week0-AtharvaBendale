You need to set the seed using np.random.seed in the beginning

In the class Tester, there are following issues in the functions: 

1. def iterative_mult(w) :
* The for loops are incorrect. M need not be a square matrix, so you need to iterate over x and y dimensions of the matrix M. 

2. def matrix_mult(w) :
* perfect

3. def comparison(w) :
* perfect

4. Plotting
* The data is not correct because of point 1
